# VEHICLE-CONTROL-USING-EYE-TRACKING
The aim of the project is to design an autonomous system that can be used by paralyzed patients and detects the action that the patient wants to perform with the electric wheelchair from eye movements. After the eye movement tracking system is implemented, a robot car will be controlled by using the movement types detected by the system.
